    |   |-file3.txt
    |
    |--folder2
    |   |-file1.txt
    |   |--folder3
    |   |   |-hello_world.txt
    |
    |
    |-hello.txt
    |-main.py
    |-output.txt
    |-README.md
    |-test.txt
```

- Here is an example with icons:
```txt
    |ðŸ“‚ folder1
    |   |ðŸ“„ file2.txt
    |   |ðŸ“„ file3.txt
    |
    |ðŸ“‚ folder2
    |   |ðŸ“„ file1.txt
    |   |ðŸ“‚ folder3
    |   |   |ðŸ“„ hello_world.txt
    |
    |
    |ðŸ“„ hello.txt
    |ðŸ“„ main.py
    |ðŸ“„ out.txt
    |ðŸ“„ output.txt
